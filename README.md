This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  Failure to remove KVO observers before the observed object is deallocated can result in crashes.  The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version. This is a crucial issue for developers working with Objective-C and KVO, highlighting the importance of meticulous memory management.
